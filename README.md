## Overview

Our goal is to create a versatile & straightforward links collator. Possible target use cases include :

1. Usage in places where only one link can be used
2. Share related research consisting of videos, articles, websites & publications
3. Micro (or even nano) blogging. [ most of the blog in www are just lists that give Top N of X , n : number and x being a category ]
4. Share content in a clean way without fluff or ads.
